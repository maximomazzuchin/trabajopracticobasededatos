-- 5. Investigate CAST and CONVERT functions. Explain the differences if any, write examples based on sakila DB.

-- CAST Function: The CAST() function converts a value (of any type) into the specified datatype.
-- CONVERT Function: The CONVERT() function converts a value into the specified datatype or character set.

-- Differeces:
-- CONVERT Function it also allows you to convert character set of data into another character set. CAST Function cannot be used to change character set.

-- Examples of usage:
-- CAST Function.


-- Compare between this query

SELECT last_update FROM film LIMIT 10;

-- And this query

SELECT CAST(last_update AS DATE) FROM film LIMIT 10;

-- We can see that the hour-minute-second in the second case is eliminated.

-- CONVERT Function.
-- Compare between this query
SELECT rental_date FROM rental LIMIT 10;

-- And this query
SELECT CONVERT(rental_date, TIME) FROM rental LIMIT 10;

-- We can see that in the second query, the year-month-day is eliminated

-- 6. Investigate NVL, ISNULL, IFNULL, COALESCE, etc type of function. Explain what they do. Which ones are not in MySql and write usage examples.
-- All the functions above (NVL, ISNULL, IFNULL, COALCE) let you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL.

-- The difference is that each of them are used in different DBMS (Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle...)

-- In MySQL, we only have IFNULL and COALESCE. Thus, NVL and ISNULL are not in MySQL

-- Examples of usage:

-- IFNULL
SELECT address_id, address, IFNULL(address2, "Alternative value") FROM address LIMIT 10;

-- COALESCE
SELECT address_id, address, COALESCE(address2, "Alternative value") FROM address LIMIT 10;
